# Table Scrape
## Python using selenium to find grub locations
This repo was set up to play around the ability to control the browser with selenium. Using a combination of clicks, triggering Ajax calls, and the ability to save and create JSON files - it helps find (but not book) available tables for any gathering.

### Getting Started
This program requires a few items to get started
* `import selenium`
* download the [Chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and place it in the root of the project folder (name it `chromedriver`)
* run the scrape program
